<strong>How it works</strong><br/>
Open the page code and enter within the first line of javascript code the amount of images you would like to display (the same number of images that exist in the img folder) and automatically the code will understand the amount of images to display in your web browser

The images in the img folder should be ".jpg" and named with the word "img" and then with numbers, example: img (1).jpg
